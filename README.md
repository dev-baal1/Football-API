# football-api

This is a Flask application that allows users to retrieve football-related data using the RapidAPI.

The app provides functionality to retrieve information about leagues, teams, and players.

Users can select a league and a season, and then browse through the available teams in that league.

For a selected team, users can view team statistics and a list of players.

Users can also select a player to view their individual statistics for a given season.

The app uses the RapidAPI football API to fetch the data and render it in the respective HTML templates.
